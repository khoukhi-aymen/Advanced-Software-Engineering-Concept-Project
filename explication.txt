1-Attempt to start the clients in the following sequential order: client2, client3, client4, client5, client6, and then client1. This is due to the use of the same timer for all clients. Each client waits for 5 clients. Therefore, the first client launched will be the one whose timer ends first if the preceding client decides not to send the token, thus correctly transmitting the purge information in order.

2-I have implemented a test in each client, giving control to the client to send the token or not. So, if the client decides not to send the token, then the next client waits for a delay. If the timer expires, then the purge information will be transmitted to all subsequent clients. Subsequently, the client that first detects the token loss will wait for all clients to receive the purge information and will then create a new token.
